The FAHA institute provides online and in-person education aimed at a broad range of humanities scholars. Participants will gain a theoretical and practical understanding of text analysis methods, and will learn how to extract content and derive meaning from digital sources, enabling new humanities scholarship.

## First Time Set Up
For this course we will be using the latest version "Anaconda"--a distribution of the Python programming langauge with pre-configured settings designed for text mining, data analytics, and more! You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#macos). 

## Code
To access the Notebooks for this course you can "clone" (i.e. "download") the repository onto your computer. 

```
git clone https://github.com/stephbuon/faha.git
```

## Data 
While students are encouraged to discover archives that match their interests, we provide access to three pre-curated data sets that can be downloaded onto your computer: 

- [The U.S. Congress, 2002-2022]()
- [State Boards of Education Minutes]()
- SIMON

#### About the U.S. Congress Data Set
The Congressional Record is the official record of the proceedings and debates of the United States Congress (from 1873 to the present moment). It is published online daily when Congress is in session. We scraped several years worth of records from "congress.gov." For a full description of the Daily Editions, or for access to different versions (such as the Bound Edition), see [Gov Info](https://www.govinfo.gov/help/crecb).
