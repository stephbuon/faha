# Foundations and Applications of Humanities Analytics
(enter description)

## First Time Set Up
For this course we will be using the latest version "Anaconda"--a distribution of the Python programming langauge with pre-configured settings designed for text mining, data analytics, and more! 

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#macos) (it may take a couple minutes to download).
- 

## Code
To access the Notebooks, "clone" (i.e. "download") the repository onto your computer. 

#### Initial Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/stephbuon/faha.git
```

#### Subsequent Updates
From inside the "faha" directory:

```
git reset --hard
git pull
git submodule update --recursive 
```

## Data 
While students are encouraged to discover archives that match their interests, we provide access to three pre-curated data sets that can be downloaded onto your computer: 

- [The U.S. Congress, 2002-2022]()
- SIMON
